/*
C++ chooses the constructor based on the type of the argument.
Youâ€™re seeing one Destructor called line at the end because:
The temporary Fixed(1234.4321f) gets destroyed
42.42f * 256 = 10859.52
roundf(10859.52) = 10860
Then in toFloat(): 10860 / 256 = 42.421875 c is 42.4219 rounded to 4 decimal places by cot
