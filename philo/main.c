/*
PTHREAD CREATE
 Spawns all philosophers as independent threads, running in parallel.
NULL: This argument specifies the thread attributes.
Passing NULL means that the thread will have default attributes.
&philos[i].thread = address of thread id
: This is a pointer to the function that the thread will execute.
&philos[i]: This is a pointer to the philosopher structure that
 will be passed as an argument to the routine function.

PTHREAD JOIN
Second loop: Waits for all threads to finish execution.
. The second argument is used to retrieve the return value of the thread,
 pthread_join prevents the program from closing early by ensuring
 the main thread waits for all philosopher threads to finish.

Each thread will receive its corresponding philosopher's data.
A thread is a routine running in background until terminated or interrupted.
Threads share resources, and have access to resources once at a time.

example: mobiles can play music and receive notifications; music player
 and the notification app both share the resource sound: when receiving a msg,
	the music player stops for a sec,
	the notification rings and then frees the resource sound again.

In philosophers, each person has a thread routine (eat-sleep-think),
	and forks are the shared resources.
To avoid forks being used by more philosophers at once,
	we block the access with mutex_lock(),
	and we mutex_unlock() when we are done.
tv_sec: seconds since epoch (January 1, 1970) struct timeval {
	time_t      tv_sec;   // Seconds since January 1, 1970 (Epoch time)};
*/
/*
pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval)
Waits for a thread to finish execution.

The return value of the thread (if any) is stored in retval.
Use case: Ensuring a thread completes before the program continues.
pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *attr)
pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex)
Locks a mutex.

If another thread already locked it, the calling thread waits.
It's possible that Philosopher 2 had just started eating, but the monitor
thread checked right before the last_meal_time update.
If so, this is a race condition where Philosopher 2 was actually eating,
but the program thought they were still starving.

Race Condition:

There might be a race condition between updating the last_meal_time and checking
for death. If the check_die function runs just after the philosopher picks up
the forks but before they update their last_meal_time,
 it could incorrectly determine that the philosopher has starved.
