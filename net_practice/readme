 NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking.

📦 Basic Concepts
1. IP Address
Uniquely identifies a host in a network.

Format: 192.168.1.5

Each IP must be unique in the whole network.

2. Subnet Mask
Defines which part of the IP is the network and which is the host.

Format: 255.255.255.0 (aka /24 or CIDR notation)

Masks are used to determine if two devices are in the same subnet.

Common Masks:
CIDR	Mask	# of Hosts
/24	255.255.255.0	254
/16	255.255.0.0	65,534
/30	255.255.255.252	2 (used for router-to-router links)

3. Gateway
The device a host uses to talk to outside networks.

Usually the IP of the router on that network.

🔌 How Devices Talk
🧍 Host-to-Host Communication
A host can communicate directly if:

They're on the same subnet (check using IP + mask).

If not, they must:

Use a router (gateway) to reach another network.

🧰 Fixing a Level: Checklist
Check IPs:

Every device should have a unique IP.

All hosts in the same LAN should have matching subnet masks.

Check Masks:

Two IPs can only talk directly if IP1 & MASK == IP2 & MASK.

Check Gateways:

Hosts need a correct gateway to reach other networks.

Routers:

Routers usually have 2+ interfaces, each in a different subnet.

Routers must have routes to know where to send packets:

Either via directly connected interface

Or another router via a next-hop IP

Ping Test (if available):

Always test from A → B and B → A

Check if traffic goes through the correct path

🛠 Example Fix
Let's say:

Host A: 10.0.0.2/24, Gateway: 10.0.0.1

Host B: 10.0.1.2/24, Gateway: 10.0.1.1

Router has:

Interface 1: 10.0.0.1/24

Interface 2: 10.0.1.1/24

✅ This works! Because:

Host A can reach Router (10.0.0.1)

Router can reach Host B (10.0.1.2) via 10.0.1.1

And vice versa

But if Host B had IP 10.0.1.300 (invalid!) or mask 255.255.0.0 (wrong subnet logic), it would fail.

🧠 Mental Tip for Subnets

🧠 Networking Basics
What is IP?
IP is a connectionless protocol that operates at the network layer of the OSI model. IP enables communication between hosts by carrying data within packets. Each host is assigned an IP address which is used to ensure that traffic is sent to the correct destination, synonymous in many ways to a postal address that we place on a letter.

An IP address (in the case of v4) is built upon 32-bits, expressed in four numbers known as octets. Each octet is 8 bits i.e one byte.

Network - the network the IP address belongs to. For example the street name.
Host - the host identifier of the device for the network. For example the house number. 
What is Subnet Mask?
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses.

The “255” address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the “0” address is always assigned to a network address. Neither can be assigned to hosts, as they are reserved for these special purposes.
