/*
Interaction between classes.

Composition (Form has requirements for Bureaucrat).

Encapsulation + validation across multiple classes.

üõ†Ô∏è What you do:

Add a Form class.

Has name, isSigned, signGrade, execGrade.

Throw exceptions if grades are invalid (<1 or >150).

Bureaucrats can signForm(Form&).

Works only if Bureaucrat‚Äôs grade <= signGrade.

Otherwise throw exception.

üëâ You learn: To model relationships where one class depends on another while still respecting encapsulation.
