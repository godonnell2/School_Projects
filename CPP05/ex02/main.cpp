File I/O (in ShrubberyCreationForm)
In ex01, you had a Form that a Bureaucrat could sign.
In ex02, Form becomes AForm, where A = Abstract.a pure virtual function like
This forces all subclasses to implement their own execute() method.

You cannot create an AForm object directly anymore. You must instantiate a subclass.
Concept: abstract base classes let you enforce a common interface, but push details to subclasses.
You implement 3 example forms:Concept: polymorphism in action â€” one execute() interface, many implementations.
This teaches guard conditions and runtime checks.
