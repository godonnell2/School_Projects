/*
private
This is where data is hidden from the outside world. 
Only methods inside the class can access them directly.
 std::string firstName; fields that store info
 They are private so that users of the class canâ€™t directly access 
 or change them, 
 which is good object-oriented design.
 public
 These are functions (methods) 
 that you can call from outside to interact with the Contact.
